    <h2>NSW Digital Standards</h2>

      The Design Standards are best-practice principles for designing and delivering government services.

<div class="nsw-container nsw-p-top-md">
  
  <p class="nsw-intro--partial">The standards ensure all teams build services to the same quality, any mandates and policy requirements are considered, and customer-focused ways of working are endorsed and promoted from the top down. Standards protect the people who use services by ensuring the service delivers as claimed, performs as specified, and is reliable, effective, and safe.</p>
  <p class="nsw-intro--partial">The standards are intended to be used as a tool to help evaluate current practice, to encourage best practices and avoid known bad practice in NSW government.</p>
